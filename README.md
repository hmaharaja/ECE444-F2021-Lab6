**Pros of TDD**
1. Unit tests help developers understand what they are implementing in large projects by forcing them to inspect each step, and may help catch minor bugs 
2. Unit tests help make code more modularized as each function or service has a corresponding test
3. Unit tests make large code structures easier to edit/refactor/update

**Cons of TDD**
1. Difficult to add into code that has already been implemented, especially if the architecture is large
2. Writing and updating the unit tests constantly can be time consuming 
3. The structure breaks down/advantages are lost if a team member does not do TDD - every team member must do it for it to be successful
